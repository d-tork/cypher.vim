Cypher Vim Syntax
=================

What is it?
-----------
This is a basic [Vim](http://www.vim.org) syntax for the awesome [Cypher](https://www.opencypher.org/) graph database query language.  Cypher is like SQL for graph databases.  You can find Cypher on [openCypher](https://www.opencypher.org/).

Why should I use it?
--------------------

Because syntax highlighting is really helpful, that's why.  Also, we want people to be able to do ad-doc queries and graph updates in their favourite shell, and not compromise readability, etc.

How should I use it?
--------------------

* Install the awesome [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) Vim plugin.
* cd .vim/bundle
* git clone git://github.com/memgraph/cypher-vim-syntax.git
* edit a file that has the extension **.cypher** or **.cql** or **.cyp**

Who should I thank?
-------------------

* [robinedwards](https://github.com/robinedwards) for extending the syntax.
* [davidszotten](https://github.com/davidszotten) for making it work with pathogen.

Thanks guys!
